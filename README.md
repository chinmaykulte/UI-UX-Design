Project Title: Case Prioritizing Portal (SIH 2022 Finalist Project)

This project was developed as an official entry for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2022, where it was selected for the Grand Finals. The objective was to create a robust and intuitive web-based portal designed to streamline and automate the initial prioritization of incoming cases for a government department, specifically addressing the manual inefficiency and bottlenecks often found in public service request systems.
The core challenge was transforming a manual, subjective case-review process into an efficient, transparent, and digitally-driven workflow.

Key Contributions & Problem Solving:
1. Tackling Manual Bottlenecks: The primary problem addressed was the slow, manual process of sorting high volumes of public service requests. The portal introduces a dynamic prioritization algorithm, automatically assigning a priority score to each case based on predefined parameters (e.g., urgency, public impact, submission date). This significantly reduces human review time and ensures critical issues are flagged instantly.
2. Intuitive Information Architecture: I designed an interface that organizes complex data points into clear, actionable dashboards. The design needed to cater to two main user types: case submitters (citizens) and case reviewers (department staff), ensuring ease of use for both non-technical users and busy professionals.
3. Ensuring Transparency and Status Tracking: A major functional goal was to increase accountability. The UI includes a user-facing dashboard where citizens can track the real-time status and priority level of their submitted cases, reducing follow-up inquiries and building public trust.

Design Process & Technologies Used:
My design methodology prioritized a user-centric approach, leveraging modern design tools and web technologies:
1. Wireframing & Prototyping with Figma: I utilized Figma extensively during the discovery and design phases. I created low-fidelity wireframes to quickly map out the user journey and information hierarchy, followed by high-fidelity interactive prototypes to test usability and gather feedback before writing any front-end code.
2. Creating a Unified Design System: To ensure consistency across all screens and features, I developed a mini-design system within Figma, defining typography, color palettes, and component libraries.
3. Front-End Implementation: The UI was implemented using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to create a responsive and accessible user experience, ready to integrate with the project’s back-end logic.
This project provided invaluable experience in translating a real-world administrative problem into a practical, visually appealing, and functional software solution during the high-pressure environment of the SIH competition.






Project 2: Case Prioritizing Portal (SIH 2022 Finalist Project)

Objective: To design an efficient, automated web portal for a government department to manage and prioritize incoming public service requests, modernizing slow, manual review processes.

My Role: Dedicated UI/UX Designer & Information Architect

Key Problem Solved: The core challenge was transforming subjective manual case reviews into a transparent, data-driven workflow. I designed the entire user journey, creating intuitive dashboards where an automated algorithm could display priority scores clearly, ensuring critical issues were flagged instantly for the staff.

Design Process & Tools:
I used Figma for the complete design cycle: competitive analysis, low-fidelity wireframing to map user flows, and high-fidelity interactive prototyping.
My primary output was a complete design system and interactive prototype, which I handed off to the coding team for front-end implementation.
The UI focused heavily on clear information architecture and status tracking for enhanced accountability.




Project 2.1: Rail Madad App UI Redesign (SIH 2024 Finalist Project)

Objective: To redesign and modernize the user interface of the official Indian Railways "Rail Madad" mobile application, the unified platform for passenger assistance requests.

My Role: Lead UI/UX Designer & Prototyper

Key Problem Solved: The goal was to enhance the existing application's usability and aesthetic appeal to encourage wider adoption and improve user satisfaction. My design focused on making the process of lodging complaints or seeking help (medical, security) intuitive and accessible, ensuring minimal friction for all passengers.

Design Process & Tools:
Utilized Figma for a user-centric redesign, adhering strictly to mobile-first and accessibility principles.
I refined the initial selection design during the finals, incorporating a cohesive visual language aligned with Indian Railway branding standards. This iterative process was crucial in developing the final highly-rated, robust interface prototype handed over for development.
